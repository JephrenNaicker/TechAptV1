# TechAptV1 - Blazor Application
This is a Blazor application that demonstrates threading, data persistence, and file download functionality. The application generates random numbers (odd, even, and prime), saves them to a SQLite database, and allows users to download the data in XML or binary format.

## Features

* Threading:
  Generates random odd, even, and prime numbers using multiple threads.
  Persists the generated numbers to a SQLite database.
* Data Persistence:
  Uses Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to interact with a SQLite database.
  Supports saving and retrieving data.
* File Downloads:
  Allows users to download the generated data in XML or binary format.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

* .NET 6 SDK
* Visual Studio 2022 (or any IDE that supports .NET development)
* SQLite (included with EF Core)

## Installed Packages
